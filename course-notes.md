# Postman Beginner's Course - API Test Automation

## Unit 1 - Introduction to API testing

### Lesson 1 - Welcome

- this course is ideal if you already know how to use Postman for creating requests
- in this course you will learn:
    - write API tests in Postman
    - automate test execution with various Postman tools (Collection Runner, Postman CLI)
    - running tests with the help of the CI/CD tool Github Actions
- Postman offers an official badge for completing this course and doing all assignments

### Lesson 2 - Introduction to the project

- before we can automate the testing of an API, we first need to do a manual test
- create a new public workspace which will store all collections used during the course
- to run or make changes to a collection from a workspace that isn't yours, you need to make a copy (create a fork)

#### üìö Resources

 * [Open Postman on the web](https://go.postman.co/build)
 * [Postman workspace - FORK from here](https://www.postman.com/valentins-team/workspace/test-automation-valentino-s-artisan-coffee-house-api/overview)

#### üÜò Troubleshooting

- if you can't get a status 200 OK reply from the sever when trying the Status endpoint, check the following:
    - ensure you are on postman.com
- if the error persists, [submit an issue](https://github.com/vdespa/automation-with-postman-course/issues/new) and add as many details as possible, including screenshots of any errors that appear.


### Lesson 3 - What is API testing

- API testing involves verifying the functionality, reliability, performance, and security of an API
- the goal of API testing is to identify issues and defects in the API before it is released
- this course focuses on functional testing


### Lesson 4 - Manually testing the API

- to automate the API tests, we first need to know how to perform them manually
- the goal of this lecture is to go through all the endpoints of this API


### Lesson 5 - Using to Postman variables to store secrets

- regardless if the collection is public or private, it is a best practice to store secrets (like API keys, passwords, tokens) in Postman variables
- Postman auth helpers can configure different types of authentication
- keep in mind that authentication can be configured on one level (collection, folder) and inherited


### Lesson 6 - Writing scripts in Postman

- automated testing is a way to check if the API works correctly by letting Postman run tests
- we write scripts to automate the testing of the API
- API tests are written using scripts
- Postman uses JavaScript for writing tests
- don't confuse JavaScript with Java, as they are two different programming languages
- console.log can be used to write a message to the Postman console: `console.log(‚ÄúHello from the Tests!‚Äù);`


### Lesson 7 - Use the Postman console for debugging scripts

- the Postman console can be used to view any information about the request and the response (URL, headers, body)
- any messages logged using console.log can also be seen there
- to clear the Postman console of entries you can use the "Clear" button or use the following script: `console.clear()`


### Lesson 8 - Writing an API test

- the following script can be added to the "Tests" to check if the response status code is 200 OK.

```javascript
pm.test("Status code is 200", function () {
    pm.response.to.have.status(200);
});
```

### Lesson 9 - JavaScript basics

- to write tests in Postman, you need to know some JavaScript basics
- these are the most important concepts you need to be familiar with:
    -  variables and their scope
    -  data types including objects and arrays
    -  functions

### Lesson 10 - JavaScript basics - Variables

- variables are like containers that store data
- you can define a variable named "name" with the value "jamie" and log the value to the console like this:

```javascript
let name = ‚ÄúJamie‚Äù;
console.log(name);
```

### Lesson 11 - JavaScript basics - Variable scopes

- variables defined within a block statement are available only to code within that block
- variables defined outside of a block statement are in the global scope can can be access from anywhere

### Lesson 12 - JavaScript basics - Data types

- JavaScript has various data types to represent information
- the most likely data types you need to know about are: string, number, boolean, object, and array
- if you are unsure of a data type you can use the `typeof` operator. Example: `console.log(typeof "John"); `
- example of an object contaning various data types:

```javascript
let person = {
   name: "Jake", // string
   age: 29, //number
   isAdult: true, // boolean
   'e-mail': 'jake@example.com', // string
   hobbies: ['reading', 'travelling', 'gardening', 'cooking'] // array of strings
};
```

### Lesson 13 - JavaScript basics - Functions

- functions are fundamental concepts in programming:
    - they are blocks of code designed to perform specific tasks
    - they allow us to organize and reuse code effectively
- A simple function definition in JavaScript:

```javascript
function greet() {
  console.log("Hello from Postman!");
}
```
- a function needs to be invoked to work, using the following example syntax: greet()
- functions can take inputs in the form of arguments:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  console.log("Hello from Postman, " + name + "!");
}
greet('Valentin');
```

- using console.log in a function is primarily used for debugging and doesn't mean the function returns a value
- the `return` statement specifies the value that a function should return after executing. 
- using `return` is necessary when you want to use the result of a function in another part of your code:

```javascript
function add(a, b) {
	let sum = a + b;
	console.log(sum);
    return sum;
}

console.log("The sum is: " + add(1,2));
```


### Lesson 14 - JavaScript basics - Methods

- you can also define a function inside an object:

```javascript
let person = {
   firstName: "Jake",
   age: 29,
   isAdult: true,
   'e-mail': 'jake@example.com',
   hobbies: ['reading', 'travelling', 'gardening', 'cooking'],
   greet: function(name) {
       console.log('Hello from Postman ' + name + '. My name is + ' + this.firstName);
   }
};
person.greet('Jake');
```

- when a function is defined insite an object, we call it a method



### Lesson 15 - JavaScript basics - Callback functions

- callback functions are an essential concept in JavaScript programming and allow for more efficient and flexible code.
- functions can be stored in variables:

```javascript
const sayHello = function() {
    console.log('Hello');
}
```
- functions without a name are called anonymous functions and can only be called by referencing the variable they're stored in, e.g., sayHello.
- functions can be passed as arguments to another function:

```javascript
function doSomething(someFunction) {
	someFunction(); // function is invoked here
}

doSomething(sayHello); // function passed as an argument
```

- functions can be defined directly inside another function:

```javascript
function doSomething(someFunction) {
    someFunction();
}

doSomething(function() {
    sayHello();
});

- this syntax is used in Postman for writing tests
